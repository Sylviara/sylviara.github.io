  On preparing for tomorrows' lab seminar, I encountered some issue about how can I say in English about get the property and attribute value. Then I searched and found an interesting issue that I haven't solved long long time ago: property and attribute in class defination in python


So what is attribute? 

> They are important concepts of object-oriented programming  which allows object have charateristic and behaviors. The answer to my question is that attributes and method can be **"accessed"** using the dot ('.') operator.

What is property?

> It's an @ method in class defination which you could use to change static attribute into a method and setting setter and getter to the attribute so that the code wil be more robust.
